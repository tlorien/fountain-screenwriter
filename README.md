---

## 🔥 Features

 **Fountain Support**  
Full support for [Fountain](https://fountain.io/) markup: scene headings, action, character, dialogue, parentheticals, transitions, lyrics, and more.

**Real-time Fountain syntax highlighting**
Instantly see Scene Headings, Action, Character Cues, Dialogue, Parentheticals, Transitions, Lyrics, Notes, and more in distinct colors.

**True “virtual page” formatting**
Your script adopts the classic 78-character page width, centered in the editor—just like Final Draft or Fade In.

**Responsive mobile support**
Portrait or landscape, your pages reflow gracefully on every screen. No more tiny fonts or clipped margins on your phone.

**Dynamic indentation toggle**
Switch between flush-left and screenplay-style margins on the fly. One click in the settings keeps you in “classic” or “modern” mode.

**Status-bar line-type read-out**
Always know which element you’re on—Scene Heading, Dialogue, Action, etc.—at a glance, in the bottom bar.

**Hover tooltips**
Hover over any line to see its type spelled out (e.g. DIALOGUE, CHARACTER), perfect for catching mis-tagged lines.

**Customizable colour themes**
Choose from built-in palettes or define your own accent colors for every script element.

**Desktop & Mobile-First**  
Lazy-loaded Node exports (PDF & FDX) on desktop; mobile-safe worker loader via Vault API; no unnecessary polyfills.
